# DATA_ANALYST_INTERNSHIP_Task8
This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship â€“ Task 8; I created a Sales Dashboard in Power Bi to analyze business performance.  The dashboard provides an efficient view of sales trends over time, regions, and product categories, enabling business users to quickly identify the top performing areas and potential losses.
